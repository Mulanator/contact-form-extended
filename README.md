# contact-form-extended
contact-form-extended for razorCMS 3.4.7++

It has an option to use googles recaptcha service (you will need to get a free domain key for your domain from google, link is included in extension settings screen)
if you dont want to use it, a fallback to the standard-contactform "delete if human" method is used.

feedback messages and recaptcha theme are customizeable.

Any feedback is welcome!
Bye, JÃ¶rg
